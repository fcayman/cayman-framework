**WARNGING**

Framework in development. I you have ideas please contact me using issues

**P.S.** My English leaves much to be desired, so I will be very grateful for help in correcting errors in the readme and comments on the methods. Thank you in advance and I apologize for the inconvenience. And I remind you that the framework is being actively developed and at the moment less than 10% of the planned functionality is covered.
